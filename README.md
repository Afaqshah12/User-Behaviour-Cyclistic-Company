# User-Behaviour-Cyclistic-Company
This project explores the Cyclistic bike-share dataset to uncover insights into user behavior and help drive strategic marketing decisions. The objective is to analyze the differences between casual riders and annual members using historical trip data.

Using tools like Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and/or Power BI, the project involves cleaning and preprocessing large volumes of ride data, engineering time-based features, and identifying usage trends by user type, day of week, and ride duration.

The analysis answers key business questions such as:

How do members and casual users differ in riding patterns?

When do casual riders ride the most?

Which bike types and routes are most popular?

Based on the insights, data-driven recommendations are proposed to convert more casual users into loyal subscribers.

ðŸ”§ Key Skills: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization, Business Insight Generation, Python, Power BI (optional)

ðŸ“Š Outcome: Delivered an analytical report with actionable insights, visual charts, and strategy suggestions to support Cyclisticâ€™s marketing team.
